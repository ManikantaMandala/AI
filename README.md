## Understanding on MiniMax Algorithm
    - Backtracking algorithm
        - Not breadth first algorithm
    - Best move strategy used
    - Max will try to maximize its utility.(Best Move)
    - Min will try to minimize utility. (Worst Move)
    - Worst-case time complexity is O(b^d).

## Understanding on Alpha-beta pruning algorithm
    - Optimized version of MiniMax algorithm.
    - Cut off search by exploring less no. of nodes.
    - Worst-case time complexity is O(b^(d/2)).
